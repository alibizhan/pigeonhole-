# The Pigeonhole principle
![Pigoens & Holes](https://github.com/alibizhan/pigeonhole-/blob/master/pigoens.png?raw=true)

The pigeonhole principle is a simple, yet beautiful and useful idea. Given a set A of pigeons and a set B of pigeonholes, if all the pigeons fly into a pigeonhole and there are more pigeons than holes, then one of the pigeonholes has to contain more than one pigeon.

_The pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item._
